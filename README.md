#Goodbye, Aura

Aura was started three years ago as an attempt to learn more about MMOs and one of the best games ever. (We may be slightly biased on this point.) Through Mabinogi, and Aura’s, various ups and downs, we’ve striven to create an international community of exploration and collaboration.

On Monday, July 20th, 2015, we were contacted by Interactive Entertainment Law Group, who were hired to represent Nexon America Inc. In short, Nexon requested the removal of Aura, as they feel it threatens their copyright of Mabinogi. After discussing the situation, we, the development team, decided to officially sunset Project: Aura.

As of 22:00 UTC (6:00pm EDT) July 21st, 2015, the forums at aura-project.org will remain offline permanently. Over the next 24 hours, Aura’s GitHub repository, Aura Lab’s GitHub repository, the Trello Board, and Aura’s other internet locations will be taken offline. (The chat won’t be affected by this.) Currently, we do not plan to remove non-Aura tools like rewpa or MabiPale, though these may be transferred to more appropriate locations.

During the last few years, we’ve accomplished a lot and learned even more. We’re all proud of what we were able to achieve here. However, while developing a server emulator is very interesting and a great exercise, we feel that it’s not worth a potential legal battle. We love Mabinogi, and we didn’t start this project to compete with Nexon or infringe upon their intellectual property, but merely to learn more about the game and development of MMOs.

With the steady decline of Mabinogi, the slow, often tedious, progress of the project, and the recent letter, we’ve decided it’s time to stop emulating an existing game and, possibly, create something totally new.

At the present, we’re unsure of what the future holds, but one thing is clear: while this may be the end of Aura, it’s not the end of our drive to learn more about creating MMOs, and great things wait just over the horizon. Here’s to the future!

Thank you for three amazing years,

The Aura team
